# Poker-Hand-Checker
This is a simple C program that checks a poker hand for a one pair, three of a kind, four of a kind, two pair, or full house.

After compiling the cards.c and checker.c files together, run the program by giving it a seed value:
./checker 43

will give the output: 
8S 9H 3S JS QD
No Hand

Here, 43 is the seed value.
